# Quick AWS VPN

A Bash script for automated deployment and management of AWS Client VPN endpoints with an integrated NAT gateway to the public Internet. Quick AWS VPN streamlines the process of setting up VPN connections to AWS environments without the need to launch any EC2 instances.

## Description

**Quick AWS VPN** automates the complex process of setting up and managing AWS Client VPN endpoints, handling everything from VPC creation to certificate management and OpenVPN client configuration. It creates a complete VPN infrastructure with proper networking configuration, including VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and all necessary route tables and permissions. The only main requirement is having a working AWS CLI setup and an AWS account with sufficient permissions. 

This tool is designed to enable an on-premises host to reach the Internet through an AWS gateway, providing a convenient VPN solution. It includes integrated PKI certificate management with authentication and encryption for easy VPN connections.

Although highly automated a robust knowledge on networking and AWS functioning is required to understand the financial costs and security implications derived from the actions performed by the program. Due to the high cost of running the AWS resources instantiated by the program its use should be limited to short lived, sporadic, low volume data transfer connections.

- **Secure VPN Endpoint Deployment**: Deploy AWS Client VPN endpoints with ease.
- **OpenVPN Client Configuration Generation**: Generate all necessary client configuration files for easy setup and optionally install them.
- **Comprehensive Resource Cleanup**: Streamline the termination and clean up of all associated AWS resources when they are no longer needed.
- **State Management**: Persist and manage the state of VPN deployments for easy tracking and management.
- **Detailed Logging and Resource Tracking**: Maintain logs of all operations and track AWS resources associated with the VPN.

## Requirements

- **Bash Shell Environment**: The script is written for the Bash shell version 4.3 or later.
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with appropriate credentials and permissions for VPC, Client VPN, networking, security and certificate management.
- **OpenSSL**: For PKI certificate generation and management.
- **jq**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
- **OpenVPN Client Software**: For connecting to the VPN endpoint.
- **uuidgen**: For generating unique identifiers.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quick-aws-vpn.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**

   ```bash
   cd quick-aws-vpn
   ```

3. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**

   Make sure you have the required tools ("bash >= 4.3" "aws" "openssl" "jq" "uuidgen" "readlink") installed on your system. If not, install them using your package manager.

4. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod u+x quick-aws-vpn.sh
   ```

## Usage

```bash
./quick-aws-vpn.sh [options] <action>
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h` | Show help message. |
| `-v` | Increment verbosity level; one level for each -v present in the arguments; can be used up to three times (`-vvv`). |
| `-q` | Suppress non-essential output. |
| `-f` | Skip all safety confirmation checks and automatically answer yes to all questions. |
| `-d VALUE` | Specify working directory (default: current directory). |
| `-p VALUE` | Specify PKI directory where sensitive cryptographic authentication files (`root-ca.pem`, `vpn-server.key`, `vpn-server.crt`, `vpn-client.key`, and `vpn-client.crt`) will be picked from or automatically created if missing (default: `<working directory>/pki`). |
| `-r VALUE` | Specify AWS region. |

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create` | Create a new AWS VPN, including all necessary remote resources (VPCs, subnets, gateways, PKI files). |
| `install` | Install OpenVPN configuration and authentication files for the current VPN to `/etc/openvpn/client/`. |
| `terminate` | Terminate all AWS resources associated with the persisted VPN remotely. |
| `purge` | Archive the current VPN state file and remove all local files. |
| `exists` | Check if a persisted VPN exists in the specified working directory. |
| `info` | Display main properties of the persisted VPN (ID, status, region, VPC, etc.). |
| `history` | Show chronological logs of operations performed on the persisted VPN. |
| `sync` | Overwrite the local properties for all tracked AWS resources associated to the persisted VPN with their remote values. |
| `remote-resources` | List remote search results for the main AWS resources associated with the persisted VPN. |
| `region-remote-resources` | List remote search results for the main AWS resources created by this program in the selected region. |
| `trace-region-remote-resources` | List remote search results for the main AWS resources created by this program in the selected region with their tagging information. |
### Examples

- **Create a New VPN**

  ```bash
  ./quick-aws-vpn.sh create
  ```

- **Create a New VPN on a specific region**

  ```bash
  ./quick-aws-vpn.sh -r us-east-1 create
  ```

  This command will initiate the creation of a new VPN on "us-east-1" AWS region, setting up all required AWS resources and generating PKI certificates if they do not exist.
